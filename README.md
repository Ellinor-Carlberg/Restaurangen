# Restaurangen
My degree project for Front End Development 2021
# Description of the project
I have chosen to create a website for a fictional restaurant.
The frontend is build with HTML5, CSS3, React.js, node.js and CMS called Sanity Client.  
My focus was on UX and creating a grafic profile for the restaurant. I also wanted to give the fictional owners of the restaurant a CMS so they could update the site with information. 

# Information about the project
Right now it is in development mode, 
the responsiveness is not completely finished. 
To watch it in tablet view choose Ipad Pro for the best version.
To watch it in mobile view choose Iphone X for the best version.

Also I have to implement scroll-to-top functionallity when you go to a new page. 

To see the grafic profile I did for the restaurant, you find it in the dokumentaion folder.
