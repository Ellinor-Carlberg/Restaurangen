          "For the people, food is heaven. ‚Äù This is as true in tropical
          chili-loving Sichuan as among the hunters on the snow-capped peaks
          of the Himalayas. Likewise in the cumin-scented Muslim deserts on
          the Silk Road in Xinjiang or along the coasts with a seafood feast
          in the cities of Shanghai and Hong Kong. So let the journey begin!
          We want to recommend you to eat here with us in the same way as
          you do there! Which means that you order a bunch of dishes that
          you then eat together. We are more than happy to help you with
          recommendations on what should be eaten with what and how. It does
          not have to be more difficult than that. Warm welcome!
