                the journey begin! We want to recommend you to eat here with us
                in the same way as you do there! Which means that you order a
                bunch of dishes that you then eat together. We are more than
                happy to help you with recommendations on what should be eaten
                with what and how. It does not have to be more difficult than
                that. Warm welcome!
