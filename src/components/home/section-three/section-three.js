          "For the people, food is heaven. ‚Äù This is as true in tropical
          chili-loving Sichuan as among the hunters on the snow-capped peaks of
          the Himalayas. Likewise in the cumin-scented Muslim deserts on the
          Silk Road in Xinjiang or along the coasts with a seafood feast in the
          cities of Shanghai and Hong Kong. So let the journey begin! We want to
          recommend you to eat here with us in the same way as you do there!
          Which means that you order a bunch of dishes that you then eat
          together. We are more than happy to help you with recommendations on
          what should be eaten with what and how. It does not have to be more
          difficult than that. Warm welcome!
